## Appointment Policies

### Cancellations

If you need to cancel or reschedule your appointment, please contact us at least 24 hours in advance so we can offer the slot to another patient.

### What to Bring

Please bring your medical card (if applicable) and a list of any current medications you are taking. For new patients, please arrive a few minutes early to complete registration forms if you haven't done so already.

## Urgent Appointments

If you have an urgent medical issue, please call us as early as possible in the day. We keep a limited number of slots for same-day urgent appointments. For emergencies outside of clinic hours, please contact SouthDoc or visit your nearest Emergency Department.
